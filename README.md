# 5-Stage-Pipeline-Architecture
The **5-Stage Pipeline Architecture** enhances processor performance by dividing the instruction execution cycle into five distinct stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write-back. This design allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution, improving throughput. Each stage performs a specific task: fetching instructions, decoding them, executing operations, accessing memory, and writing results back to registers. The pipeline operates efficiently under normal conditions but requires techniques like stalling, forwarding, or branch prediction to handle hazards. Widely used in RISC architectures like MIPS, this design balances performance and complexity, making it ideal for modern educational and practical applications.
